## How it works

Semrush gives users a centralized SEO dashboard where they can gain valuable insights for SEO, content marketing and website optimization purposes and increase their site’s online visibility.

The process of setting up an account is simple, though it does involve a number of upsells that try to get users to sign up for a free trial as opposed to a free plan.

It also asks for your phone number to set up a call, but this can be bypassed by clicking the option at the bottom to “skip.”

Upon entering the user dashboard, you can set up a new project, get traffic insights for your site (or any URL), conduct keyword research and set up keywords to track—in addition to a large number of other, more advanced features.

While it is a very helpful SEO tool, it’s not necessarily designed to teach users SEO, so it’s best to have an understanding of how SEO works before diving into Semrush.

**Its key features and tools include:**

- SEO
- Content Marketing
- Market Research
- Advertising
- Social Media

> ### SEO

Semrush casts a wide net when it comes to SEO to help ensure that you have the tools you need to improve your site’s ranking.

There are four core SEO categories, which include keyword research, competitive research, link build and on-page and technical SEO.

> ### Keyword research

Using the keyword research tool, you can discover popular search terms and identify the best opportunities to rank.

You can also manage your target keywords, track keyword rankings and gain organic traffic insights.

Upon searching for a keyword, Semrush provides a vast amount of information about the keyword, such as search volume by location, user intent, common variations of the same keyword, a list of sites that rank for this keyword, questions related to this keyword and the estimated cost per click when bidding on this keyword in paid search.

> ### Competitive research

With the competitive research tool, you can get insights into what your competition is doing—and better, what is working for them.

For example, you can view website traffic by country, see how much traffic is organic versus paid, view its number of backlinks, see its top keywords for both organic and paid, and see how its performance compares to its top competitors.

> ### Link building

The link-building tool helps you identify linking opportunities.

To get set up, you will need to input your URL, your target keywords and your top competitors.

With that, Semrush will provide a list of link opportunities, and the ability to add those you are interested in building links with to a list of prospects in progress for easy tracking.

Keep in mind that while Semrush will help you streamline the process of finding link-building opportunities, you still need to contact each site manually in an effort to actually earn links.

So while it does some legwork for you, it does not do all of the heavy lifting involved with building links.

> ### On-Page and technical SEO

Last but not least, the on-page and technical SEO tool helps you better design your web pages for search.

This includes a site audit where Semrush crawls the pages of your site and provides insights such as website health, errors, site performance and core web vitals.

It also has an on-page SEO checker, an SEO content template to help you build out content that ranks, a log file analyzer and listing management.

While the information Semrush provides can be insightful, it’s not necessarily actionable if you lack SEO knowledge and technical expertise.

That said, the site audit is a good way to quickly identify issues with your site.

However, it does not necessarily provide actionable insights for users to make meaningful changes.

> ### Content marketing

Using the keyword research tool, you can discover popular search terms and identify the best opportunities to rank.

You can also manage your target keywords, track keyword rankings and gain organic traffic insights.

Upon searching for a keyword, Semrush provides a vast amount of information about the keyword, such as search volume by location, user intent, common variations of the same keyword, a list of sites that rank for this keyword, questions related to this keyword and the estimated cost per click when bidding on this keyword in paid search.

> ### Market research

Semrush offers a variety of different market research tools.

This includes competitive analysis, market analysis, paid advertising and PR monitoring.

Using these tools, businesses can gain insights into their competition such as the keywords they are ranking for and buying ads for, how much traffic their site has and their social media presence and mentions.

These insights can be helpful, but they do not necessarily help a business directly improve its SEO.

> ### Advertising

The advertising component offers a range of features to help businesses understand what their competitors are doing and how their ads are performing.

It has tools for both paid search (e.g., Google Ads) and paid social advertising (e.g., Facebook Ads).

While the performance insights are convenient to have, it’s not as though each ad platform doesn’t offer comprehensive analytics and performance insights.

However, where it stands out is its ability to help users discover the best keywords to target for their ads.

> ### Social media

Semrush connects with most of the major social media platforms, such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn, Pinterest and Google Business Profile.

Users can manage their social media calendar, track social media posts and view social performance and analytics.

Its social media features are helpful for businesses that passively employ social media marketing.

However, it’s likely not overly suitable for businesses that rely heavily on social media marketing.
