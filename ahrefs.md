    All of Ahrefs’ core features center around search engine optimization.

- **Content Explorer** which **helps** you find new content **marketing** ideas.

> ### Site explorer

Enables users to take a deep dive into the **search traffic** and **backlinks** of any website using its URL alone.

By getting a **better understanding** of which **keywords** your direct **competitors are using** (and ranking for), as well as which **backlinks** they have acquired, you can more **effectively inform** your own **SEO** strategy, compete for your target keywords and get a leg up on your competitors.

> ### Keyword explorer

This is its own keyword **research dashboard** where users can look up keywords, see **traffic** volumes, search difficulty estimates, view **related keywords** and uniquely get potential **traffic insights.**

*It’s very similar to most other leading keyword research tools. It does a good job of displaying information, making it easier to understand. **"Forbes Advisor"***

> ### Site audit

Scans your website for **SEO errors** and provides a **detailed report** on the state of your website.

    This can be a very useful tool for discovering otherwise hard-to-find errors, including technical SEO errors.


> ### Rank tracker

Enables you to **monitor** your rankings for specific keywords and easily chart your performance.

*We like how it provides an easy way to see how your site and its target keywords are performing and how they are trending. **"Forbes Advisor"***


> ### Content explorer

    Content Explorer is not available with its entry-level Lite plan.

It enables users to find **top-performing content** in their space, including which keyword the content ranks in organic search for and which links the content has won.


## Security

Ahrefs maintains **strict security** practices to **help** uphold the **integrity of your data.**

It **encrypts personal information,** it has measures in place to **ensure** ongoing **confidentiality** and measures around user **identification.**

    However, while it is rich in built-in security systems, it does not offer users many security features they can control.

**For example:**

- It **does not offer** two-factor authentication.

- Its **user roles** and **permissions** are **very limited**, giving users the option to add users with the following three access level choices: **admin, member** and **guest** (available in the **Enterprise plan only**).
